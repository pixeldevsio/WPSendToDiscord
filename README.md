# WPSendToDiscord
Send messages to your discord bot through WordPress Ajax

This function allows you to send messages to a created Discord Bot using the bot's webhook URL. Just pass the message in through AJAX or PHP.

You can use this function either in AJAX or PHP directly.
Great for updating users when you post a new blog or update your site.

This is for developers mainly. Just got tired of no-one integrating with Discord.
